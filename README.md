# Wolfpack effect demo

A couple of simple demonstrations of the Wolfpack effect built with [PsychoPy](https://www.psychopy.org/).

To run the demo, install the dependencies within your Python environment and run the script:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python demo.py # to run the standard demo
python dont_get_caught.py # to run the "don't get caught" demo
```

You can move the "sheep" cursor around the screen by moving the mouse. Toggle the condition of the wolves (either facing towards or 90 degrees away from your "sheep" cursor) by pressing the spacebar.
